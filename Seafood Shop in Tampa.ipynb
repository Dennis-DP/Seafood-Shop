    "Florida comes as close to being completely surrounded by oceans as possible, thus this tropical peninsula has developed one of the most extensive fishing industries in the US. Your interest in opening a seafood market in the Sunshine State is understandable, so give yourself every chance to succeed by approaching your market with wisdom and a great plan. Keep your eye out for the power of Florida supermarkets—they’re steadily usurping Florida’s mom and pop fish shops. That said, muster all of your creativity and resources and you’ll enjoy smooth sailing ahead.\n",

    "Scope out the competition to make certain you’re ready to do battle with established businesses in the 40+ Florida counties already represented on the Florida Seafood Retail Market listing (see resources). Identify population pockets reflecting the demographic you seek—shoppers choosing freshly-caught fish and seafood over frozen tend to have more discretionary funds, so look for affluent neighborhoods.\n",
